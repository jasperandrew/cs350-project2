=== Notes ===

- make:        builds the executable

- make clean:  removes executable, temporary files, and .o files

- make del:    deletes the DISK directory and all of its contents


===To Do===
- finish imaps, segment summary blocks
<<<<<<< HEAD
- fix remove: it's not removing files (maybe just from being listed) 
- import does not verify a file name
=======
- do we want to make in memory data structures for inodes?
